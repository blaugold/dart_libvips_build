title: Charity bike ride

This isn't libvips at all, but I've entered a charity bike ride:

It's 100 miles from central London to Braintree and back on May 28.

The ride is in aid of
[streetchildren.org](https://www.streetchildren.org/what-we-do/) -- they
campaign to give street children across the world a voice, to be treated
equally, and to have access to healthcare and education.Â 

It's a really worthwhile cause, and I'd love to raise some money for them if I
can. Any sponsorship will be very gratefully received!
